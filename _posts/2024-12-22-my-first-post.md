# Today
## What i did
### nothing much. I just took a shower and received a Walmart delivery. that's all i did today.

# side stody
## message from my dad
### He said there's light snow at his place
#### I wish I could see snow too. I don't like cold weather, but I love snow. I want to make a snowman or a snow duck.
#### I saw the snow ducks on instagram, and they were really cute. Unfortunately, I don't have anything to make a snow duck with..
#### But it seems like there won't be any snow here. Most of the time, it's not cold enough for snow to fall(even though it feels really cold to me)

# Christmas
## Christmas is coming!!
### I don't have any plans for Christmas day. I'll just stay in my room and scroll through SNS or browse the internet.
### It's my way to spend the holiday. I sincerly wish everyone spends this holiday with happiness and good health.
