## Getting Started with Visual Studio Code

### **[Learn Visual Studio Code in 7min (Official Beginner Tutorial)](https://youtu.be/B-s71n0dHUk?si=QYHOmqAfD-OiM98M)**

I can't debug JavaScript. I think it's because I don't have the JavaScript extension yet. I also found that when I press the F5 button, some comments appear, but when I just press the debug button, it works fine. I'm not sure why it's different, but this video was really helpful for setting up Visual Studio Code as a beginner.

When I wanted to publish my code to GitHub, I encountered the issue: "Git: The repository exists, but it contains no Git content. Empty repositories cannot be forked," and I had no idea how to solve this problem. I checked that my repository was created in my GitHub account, but my code inside the repository hadnâ€™t been copied there. However, I successfully cloned my GitHub repository into Visual Studio Code and learned some basic skills to use Git in Visual Studio Code. If I were a more experienced developer, I could have understood what the tutorial was trying to explain. It's a little bit sad, though.

### **[C++ in VS Code: A Quick Guide](https://youtu.be/qeEcV6u1kV4?si=R1CfUxFmD-e9UuZl)**

I think the shortcut key for the Command Palette on Windows should be Ctrl+Shift+P, not Ctrl+P. I encountered an issue where I followed the instructor's steps, but I couldn't debug the C++ file. Eventually, I realized that it was because of the path name containing non-English characters. Besides the fact that I used g++ instead of clang, I'm glad that I was able to successfully compile and run the C++ file and learn how to use breakpoints.
