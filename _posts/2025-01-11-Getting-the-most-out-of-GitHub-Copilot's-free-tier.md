### My Thoughts  
I still don’t even know what a JSON file is or understand many of the concepts mentioned in the video, but I think it’s incredibly precise for learning what you can do with GitHub Copilot. It’s an excellent resource for understanding how to use GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code(If you have some basic information about programming concepts)
